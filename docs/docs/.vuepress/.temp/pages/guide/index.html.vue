<p>Tentacle PLC is a modern Soft PLC runtime with the basic features of a traditional programmable logic controller platform, but the process logic is written in Javascript. This gives the PLC programmer access to the Javascript ecosystem of tooling and packages which is far larger than any of the current proprietary PLC programming platforms on the market. Source control (Git), public package installation (NPM), LINT-ing, testing, and other tools are simply a package install away.</p>
