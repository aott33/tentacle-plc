<ul>
<li>Automatic publishing of variables and classes (MQTT Sparkplug B)</li>
<li>Periodic tasks for running a program at regular intervals with metrics.</li>
<li>GraphQL API (allows for a rich GUI, REST client integration, and automated orchestration)</li>
<li>Designed to use with Code-Server (VSCode via the web browser), which gives you the advanced tooling Javascript offers (unit tests, LINTing, Git source control, etc.) served right from the PLC itself. No external IDE required.</li>
<li>Detects changes to program files, with 1 click ability to incorporate runtime changes. My plan would be to expand this so itâ€™s easy to revert to previous versions, likely just integrating with Git.</li>
<li>Persistent variables (Retaining values through restart)</li>
<li>External variables sources (read/write currently via Modbus, but OPC-UA, Ethernet/IP, Profinet and REST in the future)</li>
</ul>
